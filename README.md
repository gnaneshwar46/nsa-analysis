# NSA Mass–Size Relation

This project studies the relationship between stellar mass and galaxy size
for nearby galaxies using the NASA–Sloan Atlas (NSA).

## Data
- NASA–Sloan Atlas (NSA) v1.0.1
- SDSS Data Release 13
- File: nsa_v1_0_1.fits

## Research Question
What is the relationship between stellar mass and galaxy size
for nearby galaxies in the local universe?

## Planned Analysis
1. Load NSA FITS catalog
2. Inspect available columns
3. Identify stellar mass and size indicators
4. Clean data (remove invalid values)
5. Plot and interpret the mass–size relation

## Tools
- Python 3
- Astropy
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Linux (WSL Ubuntu)
