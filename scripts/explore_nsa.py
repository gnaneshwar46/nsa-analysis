NSA Mass-Size Relation Analysis

Goal:

Study the relationship between stellar mass and galaxy size for nearby 
galaxies in the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA).

Planned steps :
1. Load NSA FITS file 
2. Inspect column names and units
3. Identify stellar mass and size columns
4. Clean data (remove invalid values)
5. Plot log (Stellar mass) vs log(size)
